# Student Grades Prediction

## Dataset
This dataset contains academic and behavioral information of 87 students with 22 features, including demographics (Gender, Age), socio-economic indicators (POLAR3/4 Quintiles, Adult HE Quintiles), study engagement metrics (Count of Module Area Logins, Total Hours in Module Area, Percent Attended), and distance to university. The target variable is `label (fail=1, pass=0)`, indicating whether a student fails or passes.

## Machine Learning Problem
The task is a **classification problem** because the target variable is categorical (pass/fail). The model aims to **predict whether a student will fail or pass** based on the features, helping educators identify at-risk students early.

**Key Points:**
- **Type:** Supervised Learning → Classification
- **Target Variable:** `label (fail=1, pass=0)`
- **Features:** 21 predictor variables including demographic, socio-economic, and engagement metrics
- **Expected Output:** Predictive model classifying students as likely to fail or pass
